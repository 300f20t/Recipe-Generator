Any contribution to the mod will be considered. Changes to the description, translations, etc. Changes to the mod code will be allowed only after careful consideration.

To build the project, you need to download [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/download) 2025.2 and install plugins from [this repository](https://github.com/300f20t/My-MCreator-plugins-pack?tab=readme-ov-file) on it (automatically or manually). After that, you can clone your fork.

This repository uses [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

If such a plugin is not yet publicly available, then just edit the plugin.json in the plugin archive. Replace "supportedversions" with the desired version.
Attention! This can make the plugin unstable!
